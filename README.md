# Machine Learning Models Evaluation

This project involves evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning models across various metrics. The models trained and tested include:

- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
- **Random Forest**

## Metrics Calculated
For each model, the following evaluation metrics were computed:

1. **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
2. **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
3. **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in the actual class.
4. **F1-Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. It is useful when you need a balance between Precision and Recall.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the counts of actual versus predicted labels, allowing a deeper understanding of classification performance.

# The Dataset I use is : MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.
